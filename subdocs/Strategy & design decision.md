During the planning phase of this project, we decided upon running 1-week sprints ending and starting on Wednesday every week. During Wednesdays we would conduct retrospective, ta-meeting Aswell as planning for the upcoming sprint. We also used a less restrictive format during the sprint retrospective as well as sprint planning to make up for us not including any daily or weekly standups in the schedule. The essence of the stand-up meeting is there for included in the other meeting. All members of the team had varied schedules and we wanted to use the practice of pair-programing to mitigate schedules colliding as well as getting the benefit of multi-developer-programming. In the end we were usually a lot more than a pair in these sessions. Some sessions were conducted with the entire team.
