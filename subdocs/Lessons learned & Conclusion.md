## Important learning experiences

As we decided upon using a lot of frameworks that were unfamiliar to most of the developers, we knew it would be one of the big hurdles to overcome. But with time we all got in to it and learned a lot about these frameworks.  
Parrallell to this course we were taught about agile which we could apply in the project and this turned out to be a great idea, we learned a lot about conducting and upholding the scrum activates as well as their practices.

## Significant challenges

The largest challenge by a great margined was that we took on all these previously mentioned frameworks. The process to learn and use these were a great challenge. It might have been a wise choice to take on fewer frameworks for next project, because this came in the way of the intentional learning outcomes.

## Needs for future projects

This project was lacking a lot of the documentations. These documents were handed to us during, or at the end, of this project. Me and my team would have wished for all these documents to be available from the start.
